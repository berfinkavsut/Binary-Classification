# Binary Classification for Heart Disease

Berfin Kavşut & Mert Ertuğrul

This project aims to demonstrate the development and performance of a number of machine learning 
algorithms on the task of binary classification for heart disease based on a feature set consisting of 
biomarkers. The core machine learning algorithms are;
- LASSO Classification 
- Neural Networks
- K Nearest Neighbours
- Support Vector Machines

More information can be found in the final project report.
